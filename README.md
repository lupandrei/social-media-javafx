# social-media-javafx

The project is to implement a social network in Java using PostgreSQL as the database.

The initial requirements include user management, friend relationships, messaging, authentication, and event management.

The application architecture will consist of entities such as users, friendships, and messages with relationships defined between them.

The ultimate goal is to create a functional social network that can provide relevant information to its users.
